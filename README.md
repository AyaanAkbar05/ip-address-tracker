# Reflection

During the development of the IP Address Tracker project, the main goal was to create a clean and responsive web app that displays location details and a map for any given IP address. The process began with setting up the basic HTML structure and styling it with CSS to achieve a good design. Leaflet.js was used to display the interactive map, and connecting it with the IP address data was an interesting part of the process.

One of the main challenges was fetching data from Ipify and displaying it accurately on the webpage. Handling asynchronous API calls and ensuring the map updated correctly. CSS styling also came with its own challenges, where I had to adjust font sizes, headers, map, and other elements so that everything looked consistent and neat. Another difficulty was aligning the map and info boxes properly. Ensuring compatibility across different browsers also required extra testing and minor fixes.

If I were to improve the project, I’d add error handling for invalid or missing IP inputs, a loading indicator while data is being fetched, and smoother transitions between updates. Adding features like search history, zoom controls, and a tooltip showing additional location details could also enhance user experience. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my front-end skills and understand how to combine API data, layout design, and responsive styling to create a functional and user-friendly web application. It also improved my problem-solving skills and patience when debugging layout and asynchronous data issues.
